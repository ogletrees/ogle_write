A framework for mapping cultural resources in landscape conservation planning

# 1.0 Introduction #
___
Cultural resources are an important component of the landscape and an integral part of conservation planning. These resources represent the connection between people and the places they live and work. They also represent the connection between today’s society and the people and events of the past. The tie to place and history can be a strong motivation for involvement in conservation planning, but is often neglected in planning efforts (Bryan et al., 2010). This omission is due to the difficulty in determining what are cultural resources and how they can be assessed across the larger landscape. Existing methods to include cultural resources in planning have been to map historical sites and structures. These historic places are seen to embody significant elements of the nation’s culture.

In addition to history are the contemporary values that people hold for places that contribute to their culture and livelihoods. Together the past and present describe cultural resources across scales, from the local community to the nation. While other attributes of the landscape, such as clean water or biodiversity, may be easier to quantify and map, cultural resources involve more intangible and elusive ideas that are associated with emotional and psychological responses of people to locations and events, such as sense of place or inspiration (Schaich, Bieling, Plieninger, 2010).

Defining cultural resources is an important starting point and provides the scope of what components of the landscape will be considered. Cultural resources have been defined by a number of groups and agencies who protect portions of our national heritage. The National Park Service states that these resources are “physical evidence or place of past human activity” (National Park Service). Sites and buildings are just some of the resources the NPS has been charged with protecting under the National Historic Protection Act of 1966. A number of NPS programs have been created to catalog and protect cultural resources, ranging from objects to landscapes (see notes for list of programs).

Cultural resources have also been defined as “a tangible entity or a cultural practice of a cultural system that is valued by or significantly representative of a culture or that contains significant information about a culture” (Page, Gilbert, & Dolan, 1998). This definition illustrates that beyond historical significance, cultural resources are representative and valued by particular groups. What is considered a cultural resource will vary depending on the perspective of different groups. Importance may be placed on locations, buildings, or structures relative to the interest of stakeholders. This will also differ across scales, from the local to the national level.

Values play a key role in the specification of cultural resources. Values, defined as “a set of positive characteristics or qualities perceived in cultural objects or sites by certain individuals or groups” (de la Torre and Mason, 2002), can be historic, social, or economic . The variety of values and significance that groups associate with different locations, such as scenic or spiritual values, contribute to the difficulty of including cultural resources in conservation planning. Since there is human history and experience in almost all places built and natural, nearly every place may have cultural value (Phillips, 1998). How places and structures are valued will change with different stakeholders, with more or less importance given depending on who is being asked.

Determining a practical method for incorporating cultural resources into conservation planning will require the consideration of cultural values while focusing on measurable attributes of the landscape. In this document we will:

* Review previous work in mapping cultural resources and values
* Propose a framework for classifying cultural resource sites
* Outline an example of how this method may be implemented

The overarching purpose of creating a new framework is to provide a clear and straightforward mechanism for mapping cultural resources across the landscape, avoiding more subjective valuations that differ depending on stakeholder groups. Through mapping these resources, historical and cultural importance can be included in the larger conservation plan and  broaden the appeal of conservation efforts.

2.0 Approaches to Mapping Cultural Resources

Including cultural resources in conservation planning requires there to be some attribute that can be measured and mapped. Identifying the locations of historic structures or sites only provides information about the geography of the past. The importance of these places is a matter of the values that different groups might hold. These cultural values describe our relationship to the past and how that heritage exists in today’s world.

Cultural values also include aspects beyond just historical importance. Features of the landscape can be associated with scenic beauty, sense of place, or recreation. The range of values, assigned to parts of the landscape, have been mapped in different ways in an effort to incorporate them into the overall assessment of ecosystems.

In this section we will present some existing approaches to mapping cultural resources and their associated values in the landscape. Techniques have varied from general concepts to data driven assessments based on economic value. Each approach will be described and strengths and weaknesses provided.

2.1 Mapping historical sites and structures

Programs focused on historic preservation present a definition of cultural resources as structures and places of significance to the nation’s past. The location of these places have been mapped across the county. Typically the inclusion of cultural resources in planning has been limited to those buildings and sites included in the National Register of Historic Sites. This dataset is maintained by the NPS and managed through its Cultural Resource Division.

The National Register program represents sites, structures, and districts that have gone through a process of designation, which includes nomination, research, and documentation of the site’s historic importance (National Register, n.d.). The program was initiated after the National Historic Preservation Act in 1966. The NPS continues to digitize information from paper records for the National Register Programs and this dataset is freely available. This process helps ensure that the places included in the Register are of value to the Nation’s history and culture.

Spatial data on historic sites is a straightforward means of cataloging places of cultural value. This approach avoids relative values about a site’s importance by using a process of designation, but only captures cultural resources deemed of “significance in American history” (National Park Service, 1995). Additionally, the focus on historical sites does overlook more contemporary sites that contribute to the livelihood and culture of an area.

Strengths  
•Rigorous process of designation and documentation  
•Broad representation of national heritage

Weaknesses  
•Scale is at the national level only  
•Limited view of cultural resources as historical sites, landscapes, and buildings  
•A singular perspective provided by data from one specific program (National Register)

## 2.2 Mapping values in the watershed

During the late 1990’s an effort was made to measure and then map the values people attributed to their communities. The focus was on the natural and built environment, the ecosystem health of these neighborhoods, and the linkage between these and quality of life. The value framework used was developed by Stephen Kellert and seeks to detail the relationship between humans and their natural environment. This framework describes the range and strength of values that people may hold toward nature in general, a particular location, or a part of the ecosystem such as a particular species (Kellert, 2012). The typology includes both positive and negative relationships (table 1).
